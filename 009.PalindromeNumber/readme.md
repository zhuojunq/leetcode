# 描述
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.<br>
#### Example 1:
Input: 121<br>
Output: true<br>

#### Example 2:
Input: -121<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

#### Example 3:
Input: 10<br>
Output: false<br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.<br>

#### Follow up:
Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
